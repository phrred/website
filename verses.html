		<p>Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.</p>
		<pre>															— Isaiah 1:18</pre>

		<p>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>
		<pre>															— 1 John 1:9</pre>

		<p>And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. 7 You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.</p>
		<pre>															— Deuteronomy 6:6-7</pre>

		<p>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.”</p>
